		<h4>"Why Did Portugal Fall Behind? Institutions and Geography in the Era of Atlantic Trade"</h4>
			<p>
				Despite Portugal's pioneering role in trans-Atlantic
				navigation, it failed to maintain an economic advantage
				relative to other countries with Atlantic trade networks.
				This article examines why, in spite of its initial
				advantage, Portugal fell behind. I argue against an
				earlier theory, and instead emphasize the role of geography
				in transportation costs and access to markets. I first
				show that the Portuguese monarchy faced constraints on
				its authority and sought to stimulate private investment.
				Second, I show that geography placed Portugal at a
				disadvantage by imposing high transportation costs and
				limited access to consumers. | <a href="z_articles/Portugal.pdf">Link</a>

		<h4>"The Potatoâ€™s Contribution to Population Growth: 1700-1900"</h4>
		<p>
				Compared to wheat, barley, and oats, potatoes provide
				three times as many calories per acre of land. As a
				result, the cultivation of potatoes, in the place
				of the alternative grain crops, has the potential
				to triple the amount of people that a given plot of
				land could sustain. Though native to South America
				, Europeans introduced potatoes to the Old World
				in the late 16th Century. After their adoption became
				widespread in 1700, the Old World's population grew
				significantly, from about 0.6 billion in 1700 to 1.5
				billion in 1900.
				Nunn and Puga estimated the contribution of potatoes
				to that growth. This article revisits their estimates
				and comes up with a revision. |

		<h4>"Economic Growth as Measured from Space"</h4>
			<p>Henderson et al have shown that satellite immages of
				light pollution from space provides a useful estimate
				of the size of an economy. This article analyzes
				that conclusion.
